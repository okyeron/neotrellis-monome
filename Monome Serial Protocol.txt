monome protocol
---------------

- extended to support variety of control, room for extensibility
- to be implemented on mk, new editions, arc, arc-variants (axis?)
- take advantage of i2c device chain system
- remove dependence on device usb serial number, replace with query system



notes
-----

new serial prefix: tty.usbserial-m0000000

mk set-number of grids, firmware versions for each size 1/2/4

should grid offsets live inside the grid subsystem?
	applies to both led-grid and key-grid.
	should each have it's own?

"all" vs "clear"

legacy bridge
	ie /press => /key
	ie /clear => /led/all 0


structure
---------

first byte of packet is identifier in the form:

[(a << 4) + b]

a = section (ie. system, key-grid, digital, encoder, led grid, tilt)
b = command (ie. query, enable, led, key, frame)
